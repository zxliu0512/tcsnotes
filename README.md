My notes on theoretical computer science. They are based on the following two books: [Elements of the Theory of Computation (2nd Edition)](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Theory-Computation-Harry-Lewis/dp/0132624788) and [Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science](https://introtcs.org/public/index.html).
